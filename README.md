- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Justdrive83
  i work 2 jobs to get by. no real spare time but lately ive found the whole termux crap on my phone interesting except i know nothing about it. i try to copy and past stuff i find but i cant realy get any progam to do anything other than install and open it. wish there was a how to what to do for each pkg
  any words of wisdom to fast track how to get something to do something would be cool . thanks
